# Defile

Defile is a gem which handles file uploads in Ruby applications. It's similar
to CarrierWave, but far, far simpler, yet more powerful. It was written by
CarrierWave's original author as an attempt to fix the mistakes of the past.

It embraces convention over configuration, as such it is not for everyone.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'defile'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install defile
